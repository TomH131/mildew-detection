        "This machine learning project involves creating a model for Farmy & Foods "
        "to accurately predict whether a cherry leaf from their crops is healthy. "
        "Currently, some cherry leaves show signs of white powdery mildew, indicating "
        "a fungal infection. However, verifying the health of each tree takes an "
        "employee, on average, 30 minutes to examine and sample.\n\n"
        "The goal of this project is to significantly reduce the time required for "
        "health assessments, as the company manages thousands of cherry leaves across "
        "multiple farms nationwide.\n\n"
        
        "**Project Dataset**\n\n"
        "The dataset provided by the client contains over 4,000 images taken from "
        "their crop fields, evenly split between healthy leaves and those affected "
        "by disease. The images depict healthy cherry leaves as well as leaves showing "
        "signs of powdery mildew, a fungal disease that impacts many plant species.")

        "The project has 2 business requirements:\n\n"
        "1 - The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate "
        "a healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew.\n\n"
        "2 - The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains "
        "powdery mildew.\n\n"
