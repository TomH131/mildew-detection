        "1. We hypothesise that the presence of visible white powdery marks on "
        "fungal-infected cherry leaves will enable a machine learning model to "
        "reliably distinguish between healthy and infected leaves. This "
        "hypothesis is based on the analysis of a dataset containing over four "
        "thousand images.\n"
        "2. The client requires the model to achieve a minimum accuracy of 97%. "
        "Although this is a high threshold, we are confident that the model can "
        "meet or exceed this target using our image dataset.\n"
        "3. Currently, farm workers spend approximately 30 minutes per tree "
        "collecting samples to check for infection. We believe that a machine "
        "learning model can drastically reduce this time by instantly identifying "
        "whether a leaf is healthy or infected. Additionally, the option to upload "
        "and analyse multiple images simultaneously will further streamline the "
        "process.\n"

        "Upon validating our machine learning model, we have confirmed its success.\n"
        "1. Due to the clear visual differences between healthy and infected leaves, "
        "the model was able to reliably distinguish between the two categories. \n"
        "2. The model achieved an accuracy of 100%, surpassing the predefined client "
        "target of 97%. This is particularly impressive given the subtle similarities "
        "between some images of healthy and infected leaves and minor differences we "
        "could see in average images.\n"
        "3. The model's ability to process multiple images simultaneously, combined "
        "with its exceptional accuracy, significantly reduces the time required to "
        "inspect each tree. Moreover, the functionality to download results enhances "
        "the practicality of the solution, enabling faster implementation of "
        "interventions for fungal infections.\n\n"
        "In conclusion, the machine learning model successfully achieved 100% "
        "accuracy on the validation dataset, surpassing the clientâ€™s target of "
        "97%. This demonstrates the model's ability to reliably distinguish "
        "between healthy and infected cherry leaves. The solution significantly "
        "reduces inspection time, offering the potential to save labour hours "
        "across the client's farms. While further testing on diverse datasets "
        "is recommended to ensure generalisability, the results strongly support "
        "deploying the model at scale.\n"
